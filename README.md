# Gist.im

#### Yet another Gist-powered writing platform - WIP

Inspired by [gist.io](http://gist.io) and similar to [roughdraft.io](http://roughdraft.io), [**gist.im**](http://gist.im) renders markdown gists as html. If you want to view `gist.github.com/danyshaanan/**8071935**`, just go to `gist.im/**8071935**`.

This is a work in progress, so if you want to do more than play around - use [roughdraft.io](http://roughdraft.io)

#### TODO:
* Add html structure + gist and gist author data
* Add css

# Gist.im

#### A markdown gists renderer

[**gist.im**](http://gist.im) renders markdown gists as html. For example, to view the markdown content of `gist.github.com/danyshaanan/8071935`, go to `gist.im/8071935`.

gist.im runs on the client, and utilizes [Github's custom 404 pages](https://help.github.com/articles/custom-404-pages/)
for catching arbitrary urls, and therefore hosted as a [Github page](https://pages.github.com/).
